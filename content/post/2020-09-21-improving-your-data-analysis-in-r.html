<p>Some useful tips for those finding their way.</p>
<div id="introduction" class="section level1">
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>The ecosystem of tools and packages for R has seen incredible growth over the last decade.
Whilst many of these enable simpler interaction with R, finding the best way forward can be a challenge.
Having a seen a few analyses at this point in my career, this session intends to show a few simple strategies for keeping your analysis and data well-organised.
The aim is that today we can learn enough of the basic strategies to enable you to begin compiling ana analysis which is easy to follow, and eventually publishable.</p>
<div id="getting-ready" class="section level2">
<h2>Getting Ready</h2>
<p>Before we go any further, we’ll need to ensure we’re working on a system that is ready to go.
Please make sure you have</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>A working installation of R. Any version &gt; 3.6 should be suitable, with current and archived versions available from <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/">CRAN</a></li>
<li>A working installation of R Studio. The <em>Desktop version</em> is the one you’re after and the one most of you will already have. The R Studio website tends to have you clicking several times before you find what you’re looking for so please use this shortcut to the <a href="https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download">download section</a> if you need to install from scratch.</li>
</ol>
<p>To make sure you have the packages you need, <strong>please copy and paste the following into your Console</strong>.
There’s no real need to understand this, but essentially we’re checking that today’s packages are installed, then installing anything that’s missing.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>req &lt;- c(&quot;here&quot;, &quot;tidyverse&quot;, &quot;rmarkdown&quot;, &quot;BiocManager&quot;)
needed &lt;- setdiff(req, rownames(installed.packages()))
if (length(needed)) {
    msg &lt;- sprintf(&quot;Couldn&#39;t find the package %s.\n&quot;, needed)
    message(msg)
    install.packages(needed)
}</code></pre>
<p>If you ended up installing packages, you will usually be asked if you wish to update one or more packages.
If this appears now, just enter <code>n</code> as these updates can take a while and we’d like to keep things tight for this session.</p>
</div>

<div id="r-projects" class="section level1">
<h1>R Projects</h1>
<p>Keeping your data well organised is fundamental to any analysis.
It usually takes minimal effort, but can end up saving considerable time in the long run.
Additionally, simple strategies for keeping your data organised can go a long way to making your analysis reproducible and transferable between computers or collaborators.
R Studio enables this to be managed simply via R Projects.
These are nothing mysterious or magical, but simply provide you with <em>a framework for avoiding common mistakes.</em></p>
<p>Let’s create a new R Project to make sure we’re all on the same page.
Using the drop-down menu in R Studio, choose: <code>File &gt; New R Project</code>.</p>
<p>(You may be asked if you’d like to save your R workspace at this point, and this decision is up to you.
If you have an active analysis, then maybe choose yes if that’s you’re usual approach, if you’re already in a new session, then there will be no need.)</p>
<p>This will bring another few options so please choose:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>New Directory</li>
<li>New Project</li>
</ol>
<p>This should bring up the following form:</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/UofABioinformaticsHub/transcriptomics_applications/raw/master/practicals/images/NewProject.png" />
On UNIX systems such as Linux or MacOS, your <strong>home</strong> directory is often referred to using the <code>~</code> symbol as a shortcut.
This should also appear on Windows machines, but represents a different directory for each user.
For me on my laptop, this is <code>/home/steve</code> but on my University (SOE) Desktop it’s <code>U:/</code>.
For today we’ll create our R Project in our home directory, so please enter: <code>Improving-R</code> as the <code>Directory name</code> in this form, then click <kbd>Create Project</kbd>.</p>
<p>I, and many other bioinformaticians, have a dislike for directories with spaces in the name, so please note I’ve used the dash to separate the words <code>Improving</code> and <code>R</code>.
To ensure we’re all using the same directories, please do the same.
At this point, you should find yourself in a clean R Session.</p>
